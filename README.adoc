= Phaster

Collection of meta tasks based on phing in order to make your build process easy.

== Installation

The installation of phaster is a two steps process. First you install phaster with composer then your need to execute a custom phing script.

1. **Composer**

The preferred method to install Phaster is through [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).
Add [triaubaral/phaster](https://packagist.org/packages/triaubaral/phaster) to the
require-dev or require section of your project's `composer.json`
configuration file, and run 'composer install':
[source, bash]
----
 {
	"require": {
		 "triaubaral/phaster": "@dev"       
	},
	"require-dev": {
		 "phing/phing": "^2.16"
	 }
  }

----

2. **Custom Phing Script**

Copy/paste the following command in your terminal

    ./vendor/bin/phing -f vendor/triaubaral/phaster/build.xml phaster::install

It installs into src/resources/phaster a directory tree contening all meta tasks
It installs into the directory where the preceding command has been done a build.xml file

== Check your installation

The command :

[source, bash]
----
 ./vendor/bin/phing -l  
---- 

will give the following output :

[source, bash]
----
Buildfile: /home/solid/tmp/exo/build.xml
Warning: target '01:source:clone' has no tasks or dependencies
Collection of meta task based on phing in order to make your build process easy
Default target:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 phaster:props

Main targets:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 01:source:clone     Copy source and test dir to a build dir
 02:source:score     Analyse source and test written quality
 03:source:resolve   Resolve source dependencies
 04:source:test      Execute unit tests
 05:source:deploy    Deploy source code
 06:source:package   Transform source code into binary format
 07:binary:resolve   Current build's external dependencies installation to make the app to run
 08:binary:install   Current build installation on specific infrastructure
 09:binary:test      Execute functionnal tests
 10:binary:score     Execute performance tests
 11:binary:deploy    Deploy binary
 12:project:version  Build specific version of your project
----

== How it works !

As mentionned above those tasks are meta !! You have to implement them in order to feet your current build need.
They are only the representation of what I consider a quality build.
